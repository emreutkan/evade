# evade

This tool encrypts a payload and embeds self-decrypting logic within it. Designed to evade antivirus detection, it ensures the payload remains undetected upon initial execution.

it also has an option to `make_exe` but it only works if you are on Windows (Linux machines cannot make executeable files)

Top left panel is the `payload` below it is the `WSL terminal` where i run this script. and on the top right it shows what the `payload` looks like after the process and below it is the `Powershell terminal` demonstrating the process of making an exe from encrypted payload
